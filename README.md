# Physical Backend

This repository contains the Python code powering the Physical API. `lambda_function.py` is the entry point for the program, as this code is deployed as an AWS Lambda function using a container image. The Physical API and the backend logic is very much a work in progress, so check back for more updates and detailed technical info!
